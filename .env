# Got these from the EmailJS dashboard after connecting my Gmail account
# Visitors can actually send me messages through the contact modal now!

# Service ID - connects to my Gmail service in EmailJS
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_sv36fer

# Template ID - the email template I designed for contact form messages  
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_oc260qe

# Public Key - safe to expose on client side, EmailJS uses it for auth
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=HTqTsoxXu_8N9-M5H

# Note: React requires REACT_APP_ prefix for environment variables to work
# These get injected at build time, so any changes need a restart
# Don't put sensitive server-side keys here - this gets exposed in the browser!
